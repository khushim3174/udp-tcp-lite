Key Features:

Three-way handshake: Client SYN → Server SYN-ACK → Client ACK

Reliable data transfer: Sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, stop-and-wait mechanism

Checksum validation: Ensures integrity of each packet

FIN-based connection teardown: Graceful connection closure

Retransmission: Client retransmits packets on timeout

Lightweight: Pure Python, no external dependencies, easy to run locally

This project is intended only for learning and experimentation. It is not production-ready and does not implement full TCP features like congestion control, sliding window, or fragmentation.
